<br />Choose `“Create a complete chatbot”.`
<br />You can choose one or many pre-defined skills for you bot. This will help you get started faster. Just select `“Greetings”` for now, but I encourage you to check the others later.
<br />Choose your name. `“joke-bot”` would be appropriate
<br />Add a description. `“My awesome and funny joke bot”` or something less cocky
<br />Set `English` as the default language.
<br />You can keep your bot `public` as there is no private info, but you can change this setting later.
